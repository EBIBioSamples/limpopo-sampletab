Submission Description	We present GERMLINE, a robust algorithm for identifying segmental sharing indicative of recent common ancestry between pairs of individuals. We use GERMLINE to comprehensively survey hidden relatedness both in the HapMap as well as in a densely typed island population of 3000 individuals. We bolster these results by demonstrating novel applications of precise analysis of hidden relatedness for identification and resolution of phasing errors and exposing polymorphic deletions that are otherwise challenging to detect.
